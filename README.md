# Aruarian Reflections
An ongoing series of personal projects designed to explore front end development, mainly in regards to digital art and music presentation, or just emulating things I find cool online.

Heavily inspired by Fauux's [Wired Sound for Wired People](https://fauux.neocities.org/) and Angus Nicneven's [Terminal 00](https://angusnicneven.com/).

**Note: Most, if not all works will require Autoplay to be allowed in the page settings of the browser used for the intended experience.**

## Current works:
### [Let's All Love Miku](https://jcurtis182.github.io/AruarianReflections/Miku/index.html)
  * Designed to host selections from my playlist of Hatsune Miku covers while also looking pretty cool.
### [Take Your Time](https://jcurtis182.github.io/AruarianReflections/P5Wallpaper/index.html)
  * My attempt at recreating a now-deleted Persona 5 themed dynamic wallpaper as a standalone webpage. 
  * **Designed to be viewed in fullscreen (F11).**
  * Current features: 
    * date and time 
    * day/night cycle
    * local weather display
    * settings menu with dynamic icons

*More coming soon...*
