# AruarianReflections
An ongoing series of personal websites designed to explore the limits of front end development, mainly in regards to digital art and music presentation.

Heavily inspired by [Wired Sound for Wired People](https://fauux.neocities.org/), and [Terminal 00](https://angusnicneven.com/).

##Current works:
* [Let's All Love Miku](www.insertlinkhere.com)
  * Designed to host my playlist of English Hatsune Miku covers while also looking pretty cool.
