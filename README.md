# Aruarian Reflections
An ongoing series of personal websites designed to explore the limits of front end development, mainly in regards to digital art and music presentation.

Heavily inspired by Fauux's [Wired Sound for Wired People](https://fauux.neocities.org/) and Angus Nicneven's [Terminal 00](https://angusnicneven.com/).

*Note: Most, if not all sites will require Autoplay to be allowed in the page settings of the browser used.*

## Current works:
* [Let's All Love Miku](https://jcurtis182.github.io/AruarianReflections/Miku/index.html)
  * Designed to host selections from my playlist of English Hatsune Miku covers while also looking pretty cool.
